            <p>
                For this project we used API calls to retrieve stock information based on the stock ticker given by the
                user.
                Selected tickers are added to a table and there are two tabs with additional info including recent news.
                In addition to this a chart is displayed for the selected ticker.
                The user can also click a ticker in the table which will reload the chart for the selected ticker.
                The user has the ability to remove tickers from the chart as well.

            <p>
                In this game the user has to guess the spelling of a champion from the game of League of Legends.  
                The user is given the picture of a random champion and the game records correct an incorrect letter guesses.
                If the user runs out of guesses then the loss counter adds one.  Conversely if the user gets the correct letters the wins counter adds one.
                In both scenarios of a win or a loss the next champion to guess is loaded to the page and the game starts again.

            <p>
                In this game a random number is generated and the user attempts to match that number by clicking on crystals.
                Each crystal is assigned a random value at the beginning of each round.
                When the user clicks the crystal that crystals value is added to the players number.
                If clicking a crystal causes the players number to be greater than the number they are trying to match then the player looses and a loss is added to the tally.
                If the player matches the number a win is added to the tally.  
                In both cases a new round begins.
